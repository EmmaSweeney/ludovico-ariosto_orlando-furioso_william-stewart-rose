			<h2 epub:type="title">To Sir Walter Scott, of Abbotsford, Bart</h2>
			<p>Who persuaded me to resume the present work, which had been thrown aside, on the ground that such labour was its own reward.</p>

					<span>Scott, for whom Fame a gorgeous garland weaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who what was scattered to the wasting wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As grain too coarse to gather or to bind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bad’st me collect and gird in goodly sheaves;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If this poor seed hath formed its stalk and leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Transplanted from a softer clime, and pined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For lack of southern suns, in soils unkind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where Ceres or Italian Flora grieves;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And if some fruit, however dwindled, fill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The doubtful ear, though scant the crop and bare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Ah! how unlike the growth of Tuscan hill,</span>

					<span>Where the glad harvest springs behind the share<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a>)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Praise be to thee! who taught me that to till</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was sweet, however paid the peasant’s care.</span>
